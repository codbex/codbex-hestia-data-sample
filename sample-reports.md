### Unpaid Sales Orders

- Basic query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CODBEX_SALESORDER as SO
JOIN
    CODBEX_SALESORDERSTATUS S ON SO.SALESORDER_SALESORDERSTATUS = S.SALESORDERSTATUS_ID
WHERE 
    S.SALESORDERSTATUS_NAME != 'Paid'
```

- Count all sales orders and group by `CUSTOMER` and order by `number of unpaid orders`

```sql
SELECT
    C.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    COUNT(SO.SALESORDER_ID) AS UNPAID_SALES_ORDERS,
    SUM(SO.SALESORDER_TOTAL) AS UNPAID_AMOUNT
FROM 
    CODBEX_CUSTOMER C
JOIN 
    CODBEX_SALESORDER SO ON C.CUSTOMER_ID = SO.SALESORDER_CUSTOMER
JOIN 
    CODBEX_SALESORDERSTATUS S ON SO.SALESORDER_SALESORDERSTATUS = S.SALESORDERSTATUS_ID
WHERE 
    S.SALESORDERSTATUS_NAME != 'Paid'
GROUP BY 
    C.CUSTOMER_ID, C.CUSTOMER_NAME
ORDER BY 
    UNPAID_SALES_ORDERS DESC;
```

- Count sales orders and group by `CUSTOMER` and order by `number of unpaid amount`

GROUP BY 
    C.CUSTOMER_ID, C.CUSTOMER_NAME
ORDER BY 
    UNPAID_AMOUNT DESC;
